==========

My "2013" CodeIgniter Starter... based on the dev version of CodeIgniter full rest support, filters &amp; maps. No core hacking

This framework is used on my OS X box (Page rendered in 0.0141 seconds. Environment testing Memory 1.4MB)

and My Raspberry Pi (Page rendered in 0.1794 seconds. Environment production Memory 0.76MB)

Using the envirnmental setting in .htaccess (that's not pushed to the Raspberry Pi) CodeIgniter pulls my OS X DB/config settings (testing) or the PI's settings (production)

Working like a charm so far!
